## Minecolonies and Structurize resource packs to match popular and requested Resource Packs

### About the Projects
Originally, this was intended to only add support for the [DokuCraft](https://dokucraft.co.uk) resource pack, as I had received a request for this on Discord.

#### Planned Features
Primarily, these will support Minecolonies and Structurizes main blocks, where appropriate - our artists attempt to use Vanilla textures where possible, so many of the blocks come with built-in resource pack support.
However, for quite a few blocks, this simply isn't possible. For these, we need a resource pack, and so, this main project and its sub-projects.

* **Building/Hut Blocks:** These are the blocks that used inside of schematics to designate which type of building it is.
* **Decoration Blocks:** 
* * **Shingles:** We add many shingle blocks, and the shingle portions cannot use vanilla textures.
* * **Cactus Blocks:** Cactus wood, and its supporting blocks (doors, trapdoors, fences)
* * **Decoratives:** Bricks, barrels, racks, sacks, construction tape, oh my! If we add it, I will support it as I have time and inclination.
* **Armor and Weapons**: We add a small number of wearables to the mod, and where they look glaringly out of place with a particular resource pack, I will re-texture them to fit in better.

##### Not Planned
I do not, at this time, plan to re-texture the citizens to match these resource packs. There are so many (1,051 textures as of February 17th, 2021), that this would take an enormous amount of time.
It may happen in the future, but its not incredibly likely at this time. As well, I don't plan to re-texture the GUI elements we add, unless they look incredibly out of place with a particular pack.

### Requesting Resource Pack support
Please make your requests here, under the Issues Tab. While I make no promises as to whether or not your request will fulfilled, be sure that I will consider all of them, though its less likely that I will have the time or inclination to work on very high res (128x+) or extremely stylized packs (example: Sphax/BDCraft).

Be sure to include a link to the resource pack, and to check and make sure that that pack has not already been requested. If it has been requested, feel free to thumbs up the request, or to leave a comment on that request showing your support for it.
Appropriate sites for these Resource Packs are Curseforge, the Minecraft forums, PlanetMinecraft, and/or the official website for the resource pack, if they have one.
Please do **not** link to sites like MinecraftSix. These types of mod and resource pack reposting sites are not safe, potentially malicious, and do not properly (if at all) give credit where due to the authors of these mods and resource packs. [See this website for more details.](https://stopmodreposts.org)
Also, please do **not** DM me on Discord asking for a pack to be supported. I get so many DM's from so many people that I lose track of them, and I **WILL** forget or overlook your request.
